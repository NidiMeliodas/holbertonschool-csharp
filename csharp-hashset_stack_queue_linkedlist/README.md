## **Requirements**
### **Environment**
- The project will be developed using **C#**.
- Allowed editors: **Visual Studio Code** or any editor of your choice.
- All files will be compiled and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using the `dotnet` CLI.

### **Mandatory Rules**
1. A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project directory.
2. Default C# files (`Program.cs`) must be renamed according to the name specified in each task.
3. **Namespaces** are not required in this project and should be omitted.
4. Each task should reside in its own directory, and each directory must contain a separate `.csproj` file.
5. Push all task folders to your **GitHub** repository with correctly named task folders.
6. Avoid pushing the `obj/` and `bin/` directories to the repository.

### **Compilation and Testing**
- You do not need to submit your `main.cs` files unless specified.
- We will use our own `main.cs` files during evaluation, which may differ from the provided examples.
