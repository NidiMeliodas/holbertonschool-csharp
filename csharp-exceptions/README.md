# README

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using Google:

### General
- What are exceptions and when to use them
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to handle exceptions
- Using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks effectively
- Raising built-in exceptions
- Implementing clean-up actions after exceptions

---

## Requirements

### General Requirements
1. **Editors**: Use Visual Studio Code.
2. **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `dotnet`.
3. **Mandatory**: A `README.md` file must exist at the root of the project folder.
4. **File Naming**: Rename all default C# files named `Program.cs` to the specified name in each task.
5. **Namespaces**: Do not use namespaces for this project.
6. **Folder Structure**: Each C# task must have:
   - Its own folder.
   - Its own `.csproj` file.
7. **GitHub Guidelines**:
   - Push all task folders to your GitHub repository.
   - Ensure folder names match the task names correctly.
8. **Exclusions**:
   - Do not push `obj/` or `bin/` folders to your repository.
9. **Testing Files**:
   - Example `main.cs` files are provided for testing your functions.
   - You are not required to push `main.cs` files to your repository.
   - Note: The evaluation process will use custom `main.cs` files for compilation, which might differ from the provided examples.

## Project Setup

1. Install and configure **Visual Studio Code** for C# development.
2. Ensure that `dotnet` is installed and properly configured on your system.
3. Follow the provided task instructions to create folders and `.csproj` files for each task.
4. Write C# code as required for each task, following best practices for exception handling.
5. Test your code locally using the provided example `main.cs` files.

## Best Practices

- Make effective use of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to manage exceptions.
- Use built-in exceptions where appropriate.
- Implement clean-up actions to ensure resources are properly released after an exception occurs.
- Keep your code modular and well-documented for easier understanding and debugging.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] All task folders and `.csproj` files are correctly named and pushed to GitHub.
- [ ] `README.md` file is present at the root of the project folder.
- [ ] `obj/` and `bin/` folders are excluded from the repository.
- [ ] Example `main.cs` files (if included) do not affect the final evaluation.

Good luck, and happy coding! ðŸš€
